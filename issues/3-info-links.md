# Issue: Info & Links

**Title**: Add Project Info, Links, and Improved Tooltips to Visualization

## Problem Description
The current visualization tool lacks external context. Users interacting with the hosted version (or running it locally) have no direct link to the source code (GitHub). Additionally, some controls might benefit from clearer explanations (tooltips) beyond the title attributes currently used.

## Context
As a portfolio piece or educational tool, it is critical that users can easily find the underlying code and documentation.

## Success Criteria
1.  **GitHub Link**: A prominent link to the generic/source repository (e.g., "View on GitHub") in the UI (Sidebar or Corner).
2.  **Tooltips**: Ensure all major buttons (especially Presets and Solvers) have descriptive tooltips explaining what they do.
3.  **Version/Info**: Display a small version indicator or "About" text.
